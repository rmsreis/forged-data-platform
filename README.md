# FORGED Data Platform

FORGED (Fusion Of Robotics and a.i-Guided Exploration & Discovery) Data Platform is the front-end interface for the Materials Innovation Platform (MIP) focused on accelerating materials discovery through AI-guided exploration.

## Overview

This repository contains the web application for the FORGED data platform, which enables:

- Exploration of materials data across synthesis, characterization, and property measurements
- Integration with AI/ML tools for materials analysis and prediction
- Collaborative knowledge sharing with tiered access controls
- Visualization of multi-modal materials data
- Connection to experimental instruments and workflows

## Key Features

### Tiered Access System with Contribution Incentives
- Users earn credits by contributing data, improving metadata, or enhancing tools
- Credits unlock access to premium datasets and advanced features
- Configurable access controls for proprietary data

### Integrated Multi-Modal Data Explorer
- Cross-domain search across materials, processes, properties, and performance
- Contextualized data visualization linking processing to structure to properties
- Comprehensive metadata for experimental reproducibility

### AI-Enhanced Analysis Tools
- One-click access to ML models and predictive analytics
- Interactive recommendation engine for experimental design
- Automated feature extraction and correlation analysis
